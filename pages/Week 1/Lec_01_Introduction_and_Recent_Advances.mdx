# 🤖 Text Generation with Language Models 📝

## How LMs Generate Text 🔄

> **Core Concept**: LMs can generate new text by calculating probabilities of token sequences and sampling from these distributions.

## Mathematical Foundation 📊

### Probability Chain Rule 🧮

Language models use the **chain rule of probability** to calculate the likelihood of token sequences:

$$P(x_{1:L}) = P(x_1) \cdot P(x_2|x_1) \cdot P(x_3|x_1,x_2) \cdot ... \cdot P(x_L|x_{L-1}) = \prod_{i=1}^{L} P(x_i|x_{1:i-1})$$

### Token Sequence Analysis 🔍

| Component | Mathematical Notation | Meaning |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| Token Sequence | {x₁, x₂, ..., xₗ} | Tokens from vocabulary V |
| Joint Probability | P(x₁, x₂, ..., xₗ) = P(x₁:ₗ) | Probability of entire sequence |
| Conditional Probability | P(xᵢ\|x₁:ᵢ₋₁) | Probability of next token given previous tokens |

## Generation Process 🚀

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Input Context 'the monsoon rains have'"] --> B["Calculate P(xᵢ | context) ∀xᵢ∈V"]
    B --> C["Probability Distribution"]
    C --> D["Sample Next Token xᵢ ~ P(xᵢ | x₁:ᵢ₋₁)"]
    D --> E["Generated Token"]
    E --> F["Append to Context"]
    F -->|"Repeat"| B
```

## Example Prediction 📈

Given input "the monsoon rains have", the model calculates probabilities for all possible next tokens:

| Next Token | Probability | Likelihood |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| arrived    | ~0.38       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| delhi      | ~0.05       | ⭐         |
| have       | ~0.02       | ⭐         |
| is         | ~0.04       | ⭐         |
| monsoon    | ~0.02       | ⭐         |
| rains      | ~0.05       | ⭐         |
| the        | ~0.30       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   |

## Technical Implementation 🔧
