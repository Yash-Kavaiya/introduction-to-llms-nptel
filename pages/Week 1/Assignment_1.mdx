# Question on Distributional Semantics

## The Question
Based on Distributional Semantics, which of the following statements is/are true?

(i) The meaning of a word is defined by its relationship to other words.
(ii) The meaning of a word does not rely on its surrounding context.

## Answer Options
- Both (i) and (ii) are correct
- Only (ii) is correct
- Only (i) is correct
- Neither (i) nor (ii) is correct

## Correct Answer
**Neither (i) nor (ii) is correct**

## Explanation

### Statement (i): The meaning of a word is defined by its relationship to other words.
This statement is **incorrect** in the context of distributional semantics. While distributional semantics uses the co-occurrence patterns of words to *represent* meaning, it doesn't claim that meaning is *defined by* these relationships. Distributional semantics is primarily a computational approach that models semantic similarity based on distributional patterns, but it doesn't make ontological claims about what meaning fundamentally is. It provides a way to approximate meaning through statistical patterns, not a definition of meaning itself.

### Statement (ii): The meaning of a word does not rely on its surrounding context.
This statement is **directly contradictory** to the core principles of distributional semantics. The distributional hypothesis, which underlies distributional semantics, states that "words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings." This approach is entirely based on the premise that surrounding context is crucial for understanding meaning. Distributional semantics specifically uses context patterns to build semantic representations, so this statement is fundamentally incompatible with the theory.

Therefore, neither statement accurately represents the principles of distributional semantics, making "Neither (i) nor (ii) is correct" the appropriate answer.

# Question on Word Senses

## The Question
Which of the following words have multiple senses?
- light
- order
- letter
- buffalo

## Correct Answer
**All of the words (light, order, letter, buffalo) have multiple senses**

## Explanation

### Light
- **Noun**: Illumination or brightness ("Turn on the light")
- **Adjective**: Not heavy ("The package is light")
- **Verb**: To ignite or illuminate ("Light the candle")
- **Additional senses**: Pale in color, low in calories/fat, gentle/delicate

### Order
- **Noun**: Arrangement or sequence ("Put these in alphabetical order")
- **Noun**: Command or instruction ("The general gave an order")
- **Noun**: Commercial request ("I placed an order online")
- **Verb**: To command ("The judge ordered him to pay damages")
- **Verb**: To arrange systematically ("Order your thoughts before speaking")

### Letter
- **Noun**: Character in an alphabet ("The letter 'A'")
- **Noun**: Written communication ("I received a letter from my friend")
- **Noun**: Literal meaning ("The letter of the law")
- **Additional sense**: Varsity certificate in sports ("He earned his letter in baseball")

### Buffalo
- **Noun**: Large mammal/bison ("The buffalo roamed the plains")
- **Noun**: City in New York state ("Buffalo receives heavy snowfall")
- **Verb**: To confuse or intimidate ("Don't let them buffalo you")
- **Linguistic curiosity**: Can form a grammatically correct sentence using only this word ("Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo")

Each of these words demonstrates polysemy (having multiple related meanings) or homonymy (having multiple unrelated meanings), which is why they all qualify as having multiple senses.

# Question on Entailment in Natural Language

## The Question
Consider the following sentences:
Sentence 1: Amit forgot to set an alarm last night.
Sentence 2: Amit woke up late today.

Does Sentence 1 entail Sentence 2?

## Answer Options
- True
- False

## Correct Answer
**False**

## Explanation

In natural language processing, **entailment** refers to a logical relationship where if Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 must necessarily be true as a logical consequence. For entailment to exist, there must be no possible scenario where Sentence 1 could be true while Sentence 2 is false.

Analyzing these sentences:

Sentence 1 states that Amit forgot to set an alarm last night.
Sentence 2 states that Amit woke up late today.

While forgetting to set an alarm might increase the likelihood of waking up late, it does not guarantee this outcome. Several alternative scenarios are possible:

- Amit could have a natural internal clock that woke him up at his regular time
- He might have been awakened by external factors (sunlight, noise, a phone call)
- Someone else might have woken him up
- He might have had another reminder or device that alerted him
- He might naturally be an early riser who doesn't need an alarm

Since there are valid scenarios where Amit could forget to set his alarm but still wake up on time or even early, Sentence 1 does not logically entail Sentence 2. They represent related but independent events, with no necessary causal relationship.

Therefore, the correct answer is **False**.

# Question on Linguistic Features in Text

## The Question
What issues can be observed in the following text?
"On a much-needed #workcation in beautiful Goa. Workin & chillin by d waves!"

## Answer Options
- Idioms
- Non-standard English
- Tricky Entity Names
- Neologisms

## Correct Answer
**Non-standard English** and **Neologisms**

## Explanation

### Non-standard English ✓
The text contains several examples of non-standard English conventions:
- "Workin" (missing the final 'g' instead of "Working")
- "&" used as a replacement for the word "and"
- "d" used instead of the article "the"

These spelling and grammatical deviations from standard English are common in informal digital communication but represent non-standard usage.

### Neologisms ✓
The text contains:
- "#workcation" - a blend word combining "work" and "vacation," representing a relatively new concept of working while on vacation
- This term is a clear example of a neologism (a newly coined word or expression)

### Idioms ✗
The text doesn't contain any idioms, which are expressions whose meaning cannot be deduced from the literal definitions of the words used. Phrases like "chillin by d waves" are using words in their literal sense, even if in a casual form.

### Tricky Entity Names ✗
While "Goa" is a proper noun (a state in India), it's a straightforward place name and doesn't represent a particularly tricky or ambiguous entity to identify or process from a computational linguistics perspective.

Therefore, the issues present in the text are **Non-standard English** and **Neologisms**.

# Question on Word Meaning

## The Question
Consider the following sentences:
Sentence 1: The bats flew out of the cave at sunset.
Sentence 2: Rohan bought a new bat to practice cricket.

Does the word "bat" have the same meaning in both sentences?

## Answer Options
- Yes
- No

## Correct Answer
**No**

## Explanation

The word "bat" in these sentences represents a classic example of homonymy - where the same orthographic form (spelling) and phonological form (pronunciation) represents entirely different meanings:

### Sentence 1: "The bats flew out of the cave at sunset."
- In this context, "bats" refers to **nocturnal flying mammals** (Chiroptera)
- These are animals that typically roost in caves during the day and emerge at sunset to hunt insects
- This usage comes from Old English "bakke" and Middle English "bakke" or "battes"

### Sentence 2: "Rohan bought a new bat to practice cricket."
- In this context, "bat" refers to a **sporting implement** used in cricket
- This is a wooden striking instrument with a specific design for hitting a cricket ball
- This usage derives from a completely different etymology - Old English "bat" meaning "club" or "stick"

Despite being spelled and pronounced identically, these two instances of "bat" have:
- Different etymological origins
- Different semantic domains (zoology vs. sports equipment)
- Different associated concepts and uses
- No meaningful semantic relationship between them

This is a clear example of lexical ambiguity that would require context for proper interpretation in natural language processing systems.

# Question on Semantic Relations

## The Question
Which of the following statements is/are true?
- Apple is a hypernym of fruit.
- Leaf is a meronym of tree.
- Flower is a holonym of petal.
- Parrot is a hyponym of bird.

## Correct Answer
The following statements are true:
- **Leaf is a meronym of tree.**
- **Flower is a holonym of petal.**
- **Parrot is a hyponym of bird.**

## Explanation

### Apple is a hypernym of fruit - FALSE
- A **hypernym** is a more general word whose meaning encompasses more specific words.
- In this relationship, the statement has the direction reversed: "fruit" is actually the hypernym of "apple."
- This is because "fruit" is the broader category that includes apples, oranges, bananas, etc.
- For example: "vehicle" is a hypernym of "car," not the other way around.

### Leaf is a meronym of tree - TRUE
- A **meronym** refers to a word that denotes a constituent part of something larger.
- A leaf is indeed a part of a tree (along with branches, trunk, roots, etc.).
- Therefore, "leaf" correctly functions as a meronym in relation to "tree."
- Other examples: "wheel" is a meronym of "car," "page" is a meronym of "book."

### Flower is a holonym of petal - TRUE
- A **holonym** is the opposite of a meronym - it refers to the whole of which something else is a part.
- A flower contains petals as its parts, making "flower" the whole and "petal" the part.
- This correctly identifies "flower" as a holonym of "petal."
- Other examples: "house" is a holonym of "room," "bicycle" is a holonym of "handlebar."

### Parrot is a hyponym of bird - TRUE
- A **hyponym** is a more specific term whose meaning is included within a broader term.
- "Parrot" is indeed a specific type of bird, making it a hyponym of the more general category "bird."
- This statement correctly identifies the hyponym-hypernym relationship.
- Other examples: "oak" is a hyponym of "tree," "sedan" is a hyponym of "car."

These lexical relationships are fundamental to understanding taxonomies, hierarchies, and part-whole relationships in language and are crucial concepts in computational linguistics and natural language processing.

# Question on Linguistic Fields

## The Question
___________ deals with word formation and internal structure of words.

## Answer Options
- Pragmatics
- Discourse
- Semantics
- Morphology

## Correct Answer
**Morphology**

## Explanation

### Morphology ✓
Morphology is the branch of linguistics that specifically studies word formation, internal word structure, and how morphemes (the smallest meaningful units in language) combine to create words. It examines:
- How words are formed from roots, prefixes, and suffixes
- Rules for word formation processes like compounding, derivation, and inflection
- How morphemes function within words (free vs. bound morphemes)
- Grammatical processes like pluralization, tense marking, and case marking
- Language-specific morphological patterns and rules

Examples of morphological analysis include understanding how "unhappiness" consists of the prefix "un-", the root "happy", and the suffix "-ness", or how irregular verbs form their past tense.

### Other Linguistic Fields

**Pragmatics** deals with how context affects meaning and how language is used in social situations, including conversational implicature, speech acts, and the role of context in interpretation.

**Discourse** focuses on language beyond the sentence level, analyzing how sentences connect to form coherent texts, conversations, or other extended language units.

**Semantics** is concerned with meaning in language, studying how words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning, including lexical relationships, truth conditions, and compositional meaning.

Since the question specifically asks about the field that studies word formation and internal structure, morphology is the only correct answer.

# Question on Pronoun Reference

## The Question
Consider the following sentences:
Sentence 1: Priya told Meera that she had completed the report on time.
Sentence 2: Meera was impressed by her dedication.

Which of the following statements is/are true?
- In Sentence 1, "she" refers to Meera.
- In Sentence 1, "she" refers to Priya.
- In Sentence 2, "her" refers to Priya.
- In Sentence 2, "her" refers to Meera.

## Correct Answer
- **In Sentence 1, "she" refers to Priya.**
- **In Sentence 2, "her" refers to Priya.**

## Explanation

### Analyzing Sentence 1: "Priya told Meera that she had completed the report on time."

When analyzing pronoun reference in this sentence, we need to consider the most natural interpretation based on syntactic patterns and discourse coherence:

- **"she" refers to Priya** ✓ - This is the more natural interpretation. In reported speech constructions like "X told Y that she..." the pronoun typically refers back to the subject (X) unless context strongly suggests otherwise. This follows a linguistic principle called "subject preference" in anaphora resolution. With this interpretation, Priya is telling Meera about Priya's own accomplishment.

- **"she" refers to Meera** ✗ - While grammatically possible, this would be a less natural interpretation without additional context. If Priya were telling Meera about Meera's own action, the sentence would more naturally be worded differently to avoid ambiguity.

### Analyzing Sentence 2: "Meera was impressed by her dedication."

- **"her" refers to Priya** ✓ - This forms a coherent narrative with the interpretation of the first sentence. If Priya completed the report on time (as established in Sentence 1), then it makes sense for Meera to be impressed by Priya's dedication in doing so.

- **"her" refers to Meera** ✗ - This interpretation is unlikely in the given context. It would suggest that Meera was impressed by her own dedication, which doesn't connect logically to the previous sentence about Priya completing a report.

The narrative flow between the two sentences supports the interpretation that both pronouns refer to Priya, creating a coherent mini-story about Priya completing a report on time and Meera being impressed by this dedication.

# Question on Semantic Role Labelling

## The Question
In semantic role labelling, we determine the semantic role of each argument with respect to the ___________ of the sentence.

## Answer Options
- noun phrase
- subject
- predicate
- adjunct

## Correct Answer
**predicate**

## Explanation

### Predicate ✓
In semantic role labelling (SRL), the **predicate** serves as the central reference point around which semantic roles are assigned. The predicate (typically a verb) establishes the action, state, or event, and each argument is assigned a semantic role based on its relationship to this predicate.

For example, in the sentence "John gave Mary a book yesterday at the library":
- "gave" is the predicate
- "John" is the Agent (doer of the action) with respect to the predicate "gave"
- "Mary" is the Recipient with respect to the predicate "gave"
- "a book" is the Theme (object being transferred) with respect to the predicate "gave"
- "yesterday" is the Time with respect to the predicate "gave"
- "at the library" is the Location with respect to the predicate "gave"

### Other Options

**Noun phrase** is incorrect because noun phrases are often the arguments themselves receiving semantic roles, rather than what we determine roles with respect to.

**Subject** is incorrect because the subject is itself an argument with a semantic role (often Agent or Experiencer), and other arguments' roles are not determined with respect to the subject.

**Adjunct** is incorrect because adjuncts are optional elements that provide additional information about the predicate. Like the other arguments, adjuncts themselves receive semantic roles with respect to the predicate.

Semantic role labelling fundamentally revolves around identifying how different participants relate to the action or state described by the predicate, making "predicate" the only correct answer.

# Question on Artificial Intelligence Concepts

## The Question
Which of the following statements is/are true?
(i) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a sub-field of Machine Learning.
(ii) LLMs are deep neural networks for processing text.
(iii) Generative AI (GenAI) involves only Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Answer Options
- Only (i) and (ii) are correct
- Only (ii) is correct
- Only (ii) and (iii) are correct
- All of (i), (ii), and (iii) are correct
- Neither (i), (ii), or (iii) is correct

## Correct Answer
**Only (ii) is correct**

## Explanation

### Statement (i): Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a sub-field of Machine Learning.
**FALSE**. This statement reverses the actual relationship between these fields. Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, not the other way around. AI is the broader discipline that encompasses various approaches to creating intelligent systems, while Machine Learning is a specific methodology within AI that focuses on algorithms that learn from data patterns. Other AI approaches include knowledge-based systems, expert systems, and symbolic reasoning that don't necessarily involve machine learning.

### Statement (ii): LLMs are deep neural networks for processing text.
**TRUE**. Large Language Models (LLMs) are indeed deep neural networks designed specifically for processing and generating text. These models typically employ transformer architectures with many layers (hence "deep") and are trained on massive text datasets to capture patterns, relationships, and structure in language. Examples include GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and similar architectures.

### Statement (iii): Generative AI (GenAI) involves only Large Language Models (LLMs).
**FALSE**. While LLMs are a prominent example of Generative AI, the field is much broader and encompasses many other types of models that can generate novel content. Generative AI includes:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image creation
- Diffusion models for image and audio generation
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Text-to-image models (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- Music and audio generation models
- Video generation models
- 3D object generation models

Generative AI refers to any AI system capable of producing new content across various modalities, not just text-based LLMs.

Therefore, out of the three statements, only statement (ii) is correct.
